                <p class="entry-text">
                    This week has been intense! Three exams in four days is no joke.
                    I spent the entire weekend in the library, surrounded by textbooks
                    and coffee cups. The hardest part is staying focused when everyone
                    around you is stressed too. But I discovered that taking short breaks
                    every hour really helps. Walking around campus for 10 minutes clears
                    my mind and I can study better afterwards.

                <p class="entry-text">
                    Working on a group project is always interesting. Today we had our
                    first meeting for our Computer Science project. Everyone has different
                    ideas and schedules, which makes coordination tricky. I volunteered
                    to be the team leader because I like organizing things. We set up a
                    shared document and created a timeline. Hopefully this will help us
                    stay on track. The project is due in three weeks, so we need to work
                    efficiently and support each other.

                <p class="entry-text">
                    Student life is all about balance. Between classes, assignments, and
                    trying to have a social life, it feels like there are never enough
                    hours in the day. Today I realized I need to prioritize better. I made
                    a schedule where I dedicate specific hours to studying and leave some
                    time for relaxing and hanging out with friends. Mental health is just
                    as important as grades. Sometimes taking a break is the most productive
                    thing you can do.
